    "\n",
    "The easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Binder**. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n",

    "Our first goal should always be to come up with a _correct_ solution to the problem, which may not necessarily be the most _efficient_ solution. Try to think of a solution before you read further. \n",
    "\n",
    "Coming up with the correct solution is quite easy, and it's based on this insight: If a list of sorted numbers is rotated `k` times, then the smallest number in the list ends up at position `k` (counting from 0). Further, it is the only number in the list which is smaller than the number before it. Thus, we simply need to **check for each number in the list whether it is smaller than the number that comes before it** (if there is a number before it). Then, our answer i.e. the number of rotations is simply the position of this number is . If we cannot find such a number, then the list wasn't rotated at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In the list `[19, 25, 29, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14]`, the number `3` is the only number smaller than its predecessor. It occurs at the position `3` (counting from `0`), hence the array was rotated `3` times.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the *linear search* algorithm as a first attempt to solve this problem i.e. we can perform the check for every position one by one. But first, try describing the above solution in your own words, that make it clear to you.\n",

    "1. Starting with the second integer in the list, compare it to the first. If the first is smaller than the second, return the first integer's index number.\n",
    "2. If the first integer is not smaller than the second, move on to the next integer in the list until an integer is found that is smaller than the one before it.\n",
    "3. When one is found that is smaller than all the numbers before it, that is the number that marks the beginning of the list.\n",
    "4. Return the index number of the smallest number in the list. That index is equal to the number of times the list was rotated.\n",

    "**Q (Optional): Implement a solution to the above problem using binary search.**\n",
    "\n",
    "_HINT:_ One way to solve this problem is to identify two sorted subarrays within the given array (using the `count_rotations_binary` function defined above), then perform a binary search on each subarray to determine the position of the target element. Another way is to modify `count_rotations_binary` to solve the problem directly."
